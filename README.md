### Truth Detector
**Is you new Employee lying about how much he got paid on his previous job?**
A potential employee told his new company that his current salary is $250k, the human resource retrieved the salary amount 
associated position levels in his previous company. The potential new employee has a position level 7.5, we would like to
build a salary bluffing detector to see if he told the truth.
